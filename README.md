# Gym Tracker

The Gym Tracker skill, on the Amazon Alexa service, allows a user to keep track of the days you go to the gym or workout. To invoke, just say “open gym tracker.” First-time users will be asked to determine their timezone to assist with date tracking. When you use “gym tracker” Alexa will ask you if “you are off to the gym?” A simple ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ will store the date and time. Feel free to ask Gym Tracker by saying “Alexa, ask gym tracker how many times have I been to the gym” or “how many times have I been to the gym since February 2017” and Alexa will tell you. It’s perfect if you are paying a trainer and wonder how many sessions you’ve used. To reset the gym count, just say “reset gym tracker.”

Finally the skill was certified and is now in the Skill Library. Click [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743K3B9B/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1501728828&sr=1-1&keywords=gym+tracker) to see!
